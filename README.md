# Portfolio Website - Built with Next.js

Welcome to my portfolio website, which I built using Next.js. This project marks my first interaction with Next.js, and although it's currently a single-page application, I took advantage of Next.js features such as the image and link components. In the future, I plan to expand this portfolio by creating components like more traditional React applications, offering more content and a richer user experience. Tailwind CSS was used for styling, providing a sleek and responsive design.
