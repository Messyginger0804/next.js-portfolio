These are conventional commit types often used with semantic versioning and enforced by tools like Commitlint to maintain a standardized commit message format. Here's an explanation of each:

1. **build**: Changes related to the build system or external dependencies. For example, npm package scripts, build configurations, or tooling changes.

2. **chore**: General maintenance or housekeeping tasks that don't relate to functional changes. This might include updating dependencies, cleaning up code, or refactoring for better code quality without altering its behavior.

3. **ci**: Changes to the continuous integration (CI) pipeline and configuration files. This could involve updates to CI scripts, settings, or integrations.

4. **docs**: Updates or additions to documentation. This includes changes to README files, inline code comments, or any other documentation within the project.

5. **feat**: Introduces a new feature to the codebase. This could be the implementation of a new user-facing feature or the addition of a significant piece of functionality.

6. **fix**: Addresses a bug or corrects erroneous behavior in the codebase. These changes aim to resolve issues reported in bug reports or discovered during development.

7. **perf**: Introduces changes focused on optimizing the performance of the codebase. This might involve improvements to algorithms, data structures, or resource usage.

8. **refactor**: Restructures or modifies existing code without changing its external behavior. Refactoring is done to improve code maintainability, readability, or to adhere to coding standards.

9. **revert**: Reverts a previous commit, essentially undoing the changes introduced by that commit. This is useful when a specific commit introduces issues or unintended consequences.

10. **style**: Changes that do not affect the logic or functionality of the code. These may include formatting adjustments, code style improvements, or changes to code comments.

11. **test**: Adds or modifies tests. This includes unit tests, integration tests, or any other test-related code.

These conventions help teams communicate more effectively about the nature of changes, automate the release process, and maintain a clear history of the project's development.
